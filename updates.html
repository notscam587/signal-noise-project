<h1>Updates</h1>

<h2>Freshman Year</h2>

<p>We all got phones.</p>

<p>The group chat was created before the first day of school.</p>

<p>It felt efficient. No more guessing where anyone was. No more waiting.</p>

<p>If someone was bored, someone else responded instantly.</p>

<p>We were always talking.</p>

<br>

<h2>October</h2>

<p>Sam started answering faster than the rest of us.</p>

<p>If the chat went quiet, he revived it.</p>

<p>If someone didn’t respond, he double-texted.</p>

<p>It was funny at first. Then it wasn’t.</p>

<br>

<h2>December</h2>

<p>He started staying up later.</p>

<p>He said he just couldn’t sleep.</p>

<p>He was still online when the rest of us logged off.</p>

<p>Active. 2:47 A.M.</p>

<br>

<h2>January</h2>

<p>Grades slipped.</p>

<p>He stopped coming out as much.</p>

<p>But he was always “there.”</p>

<p>Online.</p>

<br>

<h2>February</h2>

<p>We made another group chat.</p>

<p>He wasn’t in it.</p>

<p>We told ourselves it was easier that way.</p>

<br>

<h2>March</h2>

<p>He updated this website again.</p>
