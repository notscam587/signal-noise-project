<h1>Our Website</h1>

<p>We built this in 8th grade during computer class.</p>

<p>It wasn’t supposed to be anything serious. Just somewhere to put photos and jokes and things we didn’t want to forget.</p>

<p>Back then none of us had phones. We didn’t need them. If someone wasn’t at the park, we waited. If someone was late, we assumed they’d show up.</p>

<p>Everything happened in person. If we fought, it lasted an hour. If we laughed, it lasted the whole day.</p>

<p>We promised we would never drift.</p>

<br>

<h2>The Plan</h2>

<p>High school was coming. We said we’d stay close no matter what.</p>

<p>Phones were starting to become normal. Everyone said they would make things easier.</p>

<p>We believed that.</p>

<p>We thought constant connection meant permanent closeness.</p>

<br>

<p>Sam said we should keep updating this site. “Just in case,” he joked.</p>
