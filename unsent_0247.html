<p>Sam,</p>

<p>You stopped answering before you ever stopped breathing.</p>

<p>I thought it was normal. I thought everyone was just tired.</p>

<p>You were always there. Just not with us.</p>

<p>I keep thinking about the night I asked if you were okay.</p>

<p>You said yeah.</p>

<p>I should have asked again.</p>

<p>We built a website once that said phones would make us closer.</p>

<p>I don’t know when we stopped noticing you slipping away.</p>
