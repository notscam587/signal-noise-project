<h1>2:47 A.M.</h1>
<p>I can’t sleep.</p>
<br>
<p>I told myself I would stop scrolling.</p>

<p>
In a 2021 cross-sectional study examining smartphone addiction and sleep quality,
researchers found that
<span class="flicker distort">
"Those exhibiting smartphone addiction experienced poorer sleep."
"poor sleep outcomes may mediate the relationships between smartphone addiction and psychopathological symptoms"
"smartphone addiction, neglect of other meaningful activities, pre-occupation with the phone, distress when access to the phone is not possible, and continued use despite evidence of harm"
</span>
</p>
<br><br><br>
<p>Statistically significant.</p>
<br><br><br>

<p>I used to fall asleep without thinking about it.</p>
<p>Now I wait for the screen to dim.</p>
<p>I refresh even when nothing changes.</p>
<p>I check to make sure no one is ignoring me.</p>
<p>If they are active and not answering, I feel replaced.</p>
<p>I don’t remember when silence started feeling hostile.</p>
