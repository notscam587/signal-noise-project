<h1>2:47 A.M.</h1>
<p>I can’t sleep.</p>
<br>
<p>I told myself I would stop scrolling.</p>
<br><br>
<p class="drift">Addiction.</p>
<br><br><br>
<p>
I found myself trapped in what I had become, so I searched for an answer.
Googling and searching. I found articles, tests, experiments.
</p>

<p>
In a 2021 cross-sectional study examining smartphone addiction and sleep quality,
researchers found that 
<span class="flicker distort">
“Those exhibiting smartphone addiction experienced poorer sleep.”
</span>
</p>

<p>Why can I not sleep?</p>

<p class="fade">
The same study explains that 
“poor sleep outcomes may mediate the relationships between smartphone addiction and psychopathological symptoms.”
</p>

<p>Please, this has to be wrong.</p>
<p>I won’t listen.</p>

<br><br>

<p class="drift flicker">
“smartphone addiction, neglect of other meaningful activities, pre-occupation with the phone, distress when access to the phone is not possible, and continued use despite evidence of harm.”
</p>

<p>I do NOT have an addiction.</p>
<p>I am ALWAYS with them still.</p>
<p>I am safe with this phone.</p>
<p>What do these scientists know?</p>

<br><br>
<p>I foud myself trapped...</p>
<br><br><br>
<p>Statistically significant.</p>
<br><br><br>

<p>I used to fall asleep without thinking about it.</p>
<p>Now I wait for the screen to dim.</p>
<p>I refresh even when nothing changes.</p>
<p>I check to make sure no one is ignoring me.</p>
<p>If they are active and not answering, I feel replaced.</p>
<p>I don’t remember when silence started feeling hostile.</p>
<p>What if everyone was right… and I’m wrong?</p>
